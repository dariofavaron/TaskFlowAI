# **App Specifications**

# Project Overview

A web application designed to enhance task management through an integration of Large Language Model (LLM) and a Notion-based knowledge base, focusing on improving decision-making and task efficiency.

## **User Experience**

- **Web Interface:** Accessible via any standard web browser.
- **User Interaction:**
    - **Task Management:** Create, modify, and update tasks.
    - **Data Input:** Enter task-related information via chat.
    - **Task Summarization:** Generate and export weekly task summaries to Notion.
    - **Task Categorization:** Group tasks (e.g., work-related) for organized viewing.
    - **User Draft Interaction:** Approve, deny, or edit LLM-generated drafts.
- **Examples of Interactions:**
    - Creating a high-priority task with a specific due date.
    - Changing task status.
    - Generating summaries for specific task types.
    - Updating multiple task tags simultaneously.
    - Approval: Users approve, deny, or manually edit drafts created by the LLM.

## **LLM Capabilities**

- **Task Interaction:** Suggest task modifications based on Task Database insights.
- **User Support:**
    - Drafts modification suggestions and critiques.
    - Proposes efficient follow-up prompts.
    - Recommends task parameters and knowledge base additions.
- **Summary Generation:** Creates summaries for upcoming weeks, with Notion export functionality.
- **Knowledge Base Integration:** Accesses Notion for contextual data (read-only without user approval).
- **Draft Tracking:** Maintains a record of user-approved drafts for enhanced future suggestions.

## **Terminology**

### **Draft**

- **Definition:**
    - A **draft** is an output generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) in response to user interactions. It represents a preliminary version of content, encompassing modifications, suggestions, or new creations by the LLM.
- **Characteristics:**
    - **Content Range:** Can vary from a single word to a longer document, designed for single-screen viewing.
    - **Visual Distinction:** New or altered content is visually differentiated (e.g., through highlighting or formatting) to distinguish it from existing text.
    - **Editable:** Drafts are designed for user review and editing, allowing approval, modification, or rejection.
    - **User Control:** Each draft requires user interactionâ€”approval (green tick), denial (red X), or editing.
- **Approval Process:**
    - **Individual Modifications:** Each modification in larger documents can be individually accepted or rejected.
    - **Group Approval/Denial:** Users can accept or deny all modifications in a section or the entire document.
    - **Interactive Buttons:** Approvals and denials are facilitated through interactive buttons alongside the draft.
- **Examples:**
    - **New Task Creation:** A draft for a new task includes all relevant details, with new elements highlighted for user review and action.
    - **Status Modification:** Changes in task status are highlighted, enabling easy user management.
    - **Review System:** Features like underlining or format changes emphasize LLM changes, with each being individually manageable.
- **Real-World Example:**
    - **Task Status Change:** Consider a task titled "Water the Plants." Initially, its status is "Backlogged." When the status changes to "Scheduled," the draft reflects this change:
        - Original: "Water the Plants - Status: ~~Backlogged~~"
        - Draft: "Water the Plants - Status: **Scheduled**"
        - In this draft, "Scheduled" is bolded to indicate the new status, while "Backlogged" is struck through, signifying its removal.

## Tasks Parameters:
